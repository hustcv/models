# model practice

> Practice makes perfict.

There are three essential skills for a coder in deep learning:

- How to compute in tensor/ndarray using a deep learning tool, say, pytorch or mxnet?
- How to define a neural network quickly and correctly?
- How to train a neural network?

This repo provides an answer to the second question. We define lots of models and practice coding to build correct model.
